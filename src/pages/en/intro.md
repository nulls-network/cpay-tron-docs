Cpay's mission is to be a powerful force in global commerce, providing a reliable, transparent and decentralized payment gateway for all users around the world. Cpay's services provide a faster, safer, cheaper and more decentralized payment method that replaces the existing systems used by most retailers and merchants today.

## Project Features

#### 10000 times faster
Most people are unaware of the steps involved in a common VISA or MasterCard transaction. When you receive a "transaction accepted" notification, it's just the beginning of a series of intermediate transfers, and it will take a few days before the system can access your bank account to finalize the transaction. Time is money, and Cpay can quickly complete transactions within a dozen seconds. There are no middlemen, just you and the consumer.

#### Integrated Decentralized Exchange
The wallet address of each merchant receiving payment is randomly obtained and randomly mixed with the receiving addresses of other merchants, which allows merchant holders to almost anonymize their fund income.

#### Decentralized Integrity and Reputation
We are developing a business where, with the technical support of blockchain, Cpay can make business transparent and honest. Cpay's decentralized integrity and reputation system minimizes the possibility of unreliable business for both merchants and customers.

#### Unprecedented high-speed payments
Traditional payment systems require up to 16 different steps to process just one transaction, which is also very expensive. In today's world, this tedious operation is unnecessary. Cpay can be replaced with one step, one fee.
